# Behavioral

Padrões Comportamentais

Se concentram nas maneiras como classes e objetos interagem e como responsabilidades são distribuídas.


* Chain of Responsibility

* Command

* Interpreter

* Iterator

* Mediator

* Memento

* Observer

* State

* Strategy

* Template Method

* Visitor

* Chain of responsibility

delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.

* Command

creates objects that encapsulate actions and parameters.

* Interpreter

implements a specialized language.

* Iterator

accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

* Mediator

allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.

* Memento 

provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo).

* Observer 

is a publish/subscribe pattern, which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.

* State

allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

* Strategy

allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.

* Template method

defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.

Visitor separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the 
hierarchy of methods into one object.
